# Structure–Aware Surface Reconstruction via Primitive Assembly

![](./images/overview.png)

<p align="center">The pipeline of PrimFit reconstruction</p>

PrimFit is the implementation for reconstruction method described in  paper “Structure–Aware Surface Reconstruction via Primitive Assembly”(ICCV2023).

In this paper, we extend the hypothesis and selection idea of plane-baed surface reconstruction method, [PolyFit](https://github.com/LiangliangNan/PolyFit) , to multi-type primitives and introduce an effective pruning mechanism to speed up extraction step (selection) significantly.

## Code

Currently, I am refactoring the code, and it will be available soon.

## Maintaince
