# Structure–Aware Surface Reconstruction via Primitive Assembly

![](./images/overview.png)



**PrimFit** is the implementation of reconstruction method described in  paper “**Structure–Aware Surface Reconstruction via Primitive Assembly**”.

In this paper, we extend the hypothesis and selection idea of plane-baed surface reconstruction method, [PolyFit](https://github.com/LiangliangNan/PolyFit) , to multi-type primitives and introduce an effective pruning mechanism to speed up extraction step (selection) significantly.

## Code

Currently, I am refactoring the code, and it will be available soon.
